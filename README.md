# seven-segment-display

I have written a program that helps you find out what the longest word you can write with a seven segment display with set parameters.
The parameters I have set it are that you are not allow to use the letters g,k,m,q,v,w,x,z. This parameter shortons the words that you can look through to get an answer.

# The expected outcome for this program is:

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane

This could change if you changed the parameters in my code. For example if I made the parameters stricter so that I could not use I or O because they look very similar to 1 and 0.

# Example of outcome if code was changed:

supertranscendentness
